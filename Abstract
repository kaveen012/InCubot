presents IncuBot, an IoT-enabled robotic system designed to automate manual procedures within microbiological incubators,
thereby enhancing operational efficiency and reducing contamination risks. Manual handling of culture plates in laboratory
settings is prone to human error, introduces contaminants, and poses biosafety risks. IncuBot addresses these challenges 
through a custom-designed 4-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) robotic arm, controlled via a MATLAB application. The methodology 
involved the 3D parametric design of the arm, development of a custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB) with an ESP32 microcontroller,
and implementation of a robust control interface that overcomes the limitations of initial vision-based approaches.
 The results demonstrate a functional prototype capable of precise and repeatable movements (Â±0.1 mm), successfully automating plate handling tasks.
 The system's modular, cost-effective design presents a viable alternative to expensive commercial systems, significantly improving laboratory safety,
 productivity, and the integrity of microbiological research.
